## Using GitHub and Git

In order to deliver the assignments, you will have to create your own private repository.

To do this, send me an e-mail at tim.teige91@gmail.com. I will then send you a link which works as an invite to the github classroom.

To actually deliver the assignment, just clone this new private repository and copy over your implementation and add a new folder for the report.

In the next assignment, you should start by cloning the repository and work inside it, this will give you the option to fully utilize git, and I will be able to see your code as you work on it.

Step by step:

1. git clone private_repository_url

2. copy over the files / work on the assignment

3. git add . (to add all new or changed files)

4. git commit -m "Commit message"

5. git push

6. Enter username and password if prompted

At the end of the deadline I will clone the repositories.

You can still continue to work on the assignment after the deadline, but unless you have received an extension it will be for yourself.
